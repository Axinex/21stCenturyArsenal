# 21st Century Arsenal
Yet another RimWorld mod that adds more modern guns

# A Big Disclaimer!
This mod is EXTREMELY incomplete. By downloading and using this mod, you accept that you will be one of my guinea pigs and that you will likely be subject to a great many imbalanced and/or straight-up broken weapons and items. Don't worry, we'll iron that stuff out.
